## Attention

 1. **Do not abuse service from Doprax or your account could get banned. Deploy at your own risk.**
 2. **High disk usage will likely get your account banned.**
 3. Aria2 & qBittorrent download speed is limited to 5MB/s on default.
 4. Container filesystem is ephemeral - that means that any changes to the filesystem except volume mounted on /mnt/data/config whilst the dyno is running only last until that container is shut down or restarted.
 5. It is not possible to configure a Rclone remote which requires web authentication through Rclone Web UI in this app. You need to prepare rclone.conf file on other devices.
 6. No Rclone mount support.

## <a id="more"></a>More usages and precautions

 1. To enable Telegram notification function, you need to talk to @BotFather in Telegram to register a bot. Get ChatID of your Telegram account or ChatID of the channel which bot joined. Please Google for detailed steps.
 
    Edit the config/script.conf file. Fill in the corresponding options for botid:token and ChatID, then the notification function will take effect.
 2. Known pyLoad bugs：
    - Fail to delete archives after extraction, solution: Settings--Plugins--ExtractArchive, set "Move to trash instead delete" to off.
 3. After adding following content to rclone.conf file, you can use local container storage as a Rclone remote for manually uploading via Rclone Web UI.

      ```
      [local]
      type = alias
      remote = /mnt/data
      ```

 4. For apps which don't support custom path for qBittorrent, uncomment followings line in Caddyfile under config/caddy folder before deployment:

            handle /api* {       
                    reverse_proxy * localhost:61804
            }

 5. Aria2 JSON-RPC path： \${GLOBAL_PORTAL_PATH}/jsonrpc   
    Aria2 XML-RPC path： \${GLOBAL_PORTAL_PATH}/rpc
